    "\n",
    "The Python extension by Microsoft is essential for Python development in VS Code. It provides syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, error detection, debugging, and Jupyter notebook support.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the official VS Code documentation to install the Python extension:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Python Extension on VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)** — Click \"Install\" to open VS Code and install directly\n",

    "\n",
    "The Python extension automatically includes:\n",
    "- **Pylance** — Fast, feature-rich language support\n",
    "- **Python Debugger** — For stepping through code\n",

    "1. Go to **File → New File** (or press `Ctrl+N` / `Cmd+N` on Mac)\n",
    "2. Go to **File → Save As** (or press `Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S` on Mac)\n",
    "3. Save the file as `test.py` (the `.py` extension is important!)\n",

    "### Jupyter (Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:** Lets you run Jupyter notebooks directly in VS Code\n",
    "\n",

    "### Python Indent\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:** Automatically fixes Python indentation when you press Enter\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it's useful:** Python is sensitive to indentation. This extension helps you avoid common indentation errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To install:** Search for \"Python Indent\" by Kevin Rose in the Extensions view, or visit the [Python Indent Extension on VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KevinRose.vsc-python-indent)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rainbow CSV\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:** Colors columns in CSV files for easier reading\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it's useful:** As water modellers, we work with lots of CSV data. This makes viewing data files much easier.\n",
