    "\n",
    "### The Current Reality\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're a water modeller, you probably use:\n",
    "- **Excel** for data processing and simple calculations\n",
    "- **Specialized software** (HEC-RAS, MIKE, MODFLOW GUI, SWMM, etc.)\n",
    "- **Copy-paste workflows** to move data between tools\n",
    "- **Manual processes** that need to be repeated for each new dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**This works... until:**\n",
    "- You need to process data from 50 stations instead of 5\n",
    "- You want to rerun last year's analysis with updated data\n",
    "- A colleague asks \"how did you do that calculation?\"\n",
    "- You need to document your workflow for a report\n",
    "- The data format changes slightly\n",

    "\n",
    "AI is a **tool that helps you code**, not a replacement for understanding:\n",
    "- You need to know what to ask for\n",
    "- You need to verify the results make sense\n",
    "- You need to adapt code to your specific needs\n",
    "- You need to debug when things go wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it this way:** Calculators exist, but you still need to know what calculation to do.\n",

    "Common reasons people quit:\n",
    "- ❌ Generic tutorials not relevant to their work\n",
    "- ❌ Spent hours on setup before writing any code\n",
