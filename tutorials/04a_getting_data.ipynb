    "\n",
    "Before you can analyze discharge patterns, calibrate a model, or validate flood predictions, you need data. And getting that data is often harder than the analysis itself.\n",

    "| Challenge | Example |\n",
    "|-----------|--------|\n",
    "| **Different formats** | CSV, Excel, XML, proprietary formats, PDF tables |\n",
    "| **Different sources** | National agencies, research institutions, utilities |\n",
    "| **Access restrictions** | Some data requires registration, payment, or formal requests |\n",
    "| **Quality variations** | Gaps, errors, different QA procedures |\n",
    "| **Different conventions** | Date formats, time zones, units (m³/s vs. L/s vs. cfs) |\n",
    "| **Documentation gaps** | Missing metadata about station location, catchment area |\n",

There are two types:\n\n**Absolute Path** (Full address from the root of your computer)\n```python\n'/Users/yourname/Documents/project/data/my_data.csv'  # macOS/Linux\n'C:\\\\Users\\\\yourname\\\\Documents\\\\project\\\\data\\\\my_data.csv'  # Windows\n```\n\n**Relative Path** (Address relative to your current location)\n```python\n'../data/my_data.csv'  # Go up one folder, then into data/\n```\n\n#### Our Project Structure\n\n```\npython-for-water-modellers/          ← Project root\n├── data/                            ← Data folder\n│   └── camels_01013500_discharge.csv                  \n├── tutorials/                       ← We are HERE (this notebook)\n│   ├── 04a_getting_data.ipynb      \n│   └── 04b_discharge_analysis.ipynb\n```\n\nWhen running **locally** in VS Code, the notebook runs from `tutorials/`, so we use `../data/` to go up one level.\n\nWhen running in **Binder** (cloud), the working directory is the project root, so we use `data/` directly.\n\n#### Smart Path Resolution\n\nThe code below automatically detects which environment you're in and uses the correct path:"
