    "| **Access restrictions** | Some data requires registration, payment, or formal requests |\n",
    "| **Quality variations** | Gaps, errors, different QA procedures |\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Why getting hydrological data is challenging  \n",
    "✅ Key open data sources (CAMELS family, GRDC, Caravan)  \n",
    "✅ How to access CAMELS data programmatically with PyGeoHydro  \n",
    "✅ How to explore, select, and download station data  \n",
    "✅ How to save data for offline analysis  \n",
    "✅ Where to find CAMELS-CH for Swiss-specific work  \n",
    "✅ What to check for data quality  \n",

    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open datasets exist** — You don't always need to process raw data from scratch\n",
    "2. **Python makes access easy** — A few lines of code can replace hours of manual downloads\n",
    "3. **Always check quality** — Even curated datasets may have issues\n",
    "4. **Save locally** — Once you have good data, save it for reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Created\n",
    "\n",
    "By running the code cells in this notebook, you:\n",
    "- Explored available CAMELS stations\n",
    "- Downloaded streamflow data for your chosen station\n",
    "- Created a CSV file: `camels_XXXXX_discharge.csv` in the `data/` folder\n",
    "- Generated a preview plot of the hydrograph\n",
