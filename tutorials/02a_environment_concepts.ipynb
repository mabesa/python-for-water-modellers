    "## The Problem: Why Can't We Just Install Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering: *\"Why all this complexity? Can't I just install Python and start coding?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, yes. But here's what happens in practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario 1: Version Conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have two projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Project A** (from 2022): Uses `pandas` version 1.4, which your old analysis scripts depend on\n",
    "- **Project B** (new): Needs `pandas` version 2.0 for new features\n",
    "\n",
    "If Python packages are installed globally (for your whole computer), you can only have ONE version of pandas. Updating for Project B breaks Project A. This is called **dependency hell**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario 2: The \"Works on My Machine\" Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "You write a script that works perfectly on your computer. You send it to a colleague, and it crashes. Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "- You have `numpy` version 1.24, they have 1.21\n",
    "- You have `matplotlib` 3.8, they have 3.5\n",
    "- Some function you used doesn't exist in their older versions\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a way to specify *exactly* which versions you used, sharing code becomes frustrating.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario 3: System Python Chaos\n",
    "\n",
    "Many operating systems come with Python pre-installed (macOS, Linux). This \"system Python\" is used by the operating system itself. If you accidentally break it by installing incompatible packages, you can break system tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "Never modify the system Python on macOS or Linux. It can break your operating system's tools!\n",

    "## The Traditional Approach (And Why It's Painful)\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, Python developers used these tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Manual Python Installation\n",
    "- Download Python from python.org\n",
    "- Run the installer\n",
    "- Hope it doesn't conflict with existing installations\n",
    "- Repeat for each Python version you need\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. pip (Package Installer for Python)\n",
    "- The standard tool for installing packages\n",
    "- `pip install pandas` installs pandas\n",
    "- **Problem:** Slow, doesn't handle version conflicts well\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. venv (Virtual Environment Module)\n",
    "- Built into Python 3.3+\n",
    "- `python -m venv .venv` creates an environment\n",
    "- **Problem:** You need Python installed first, manual activation required\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Traditional Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# 1. Install Python manually (varies by OS)\n",
    "# 2. Create a virtual environment\n",
    "python -m venv .venv\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Activate it (different command per OS!)\n",
    "# Windows:\n",
    ".venv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "# Mac/Linux:\n",
    "source .venv/bin/activate\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Install packages (slow)\n",
    "pip install pandas numpy matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Remember to activate every time you work on the project!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems with this approach:**\n",
    "- Multiple steps to remember\n",
    "- Different commands for different operating systems\n",
    "- Forgetting to activate leads to confusing errors\n",
    "- pip is slow and sometimes fails on complex dependencies\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Fast** — Written in Rust, 10-100x faster than pip\n",
    "- **Simple** — One tool does everything\n",
    "- **Automatic** — Handles Python installation and environments for you\n",
    "- **Reliable** — Better dependency resolution, fewer conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "### What uv Does For You\n",
    "\n",
    "| Task | Traditional Way | With uv |\n",
    "|------|-----------------|----------|\n",
    "| Install Python | Download from python.org, run installer | `uv python install 3.12` |\n",
    "| Create project | Multiple manual steps | `uv init my-project` |\n",
    "| Create environment | `python -m venv .venv` + activate | Automatic! |\n",
    "| Install packages | `pip install pandas` (slow) | `uv add pandas` (fast) |\n",
    "| Run scripts | Activate env first, then `python script.py` | `uv run script.py` |\n",
    "| Share with colleagues | Create requirements.txt manually | `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` created automatically |\n",
    "\n",
    "### The uv Workflow (Preview)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what working with uv looks like (you'll do this in the next module):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Create a new project (creates folder, environment, config files)\n",
    "uv init my-water-project\n",
    "cd my-water-project\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add packages (automatically installs into the environment)\n",

    "# Run your script (automatically uses the right environment)\n",
    "uv run analyze_discharge.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! No activation commands, no remembering which environment you're in, no slow installations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "uv was released in 2024 by Astral (the company behind the popular `ruff` Python linter). It's quickly becoming the recommended tool for Python project management.\n",

    "]\n",
    "```\n",

    "### `uv.lock`\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"lockfile\" that records the *exact* versions of every package installed. This ensures:\n",

    "\n",
    "As a water modeller, proper environment management gives you:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Reproducible Analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write a flood frequency analysis in 2024, you want it to produce the *same results* in 2027. With locked dependencies, it will.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Easy Collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "Share your project folder with a colleague. They run `uv sync` and get *exactly* your environment. No more \"it works on my machine\" problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Clean Separation\n",
    "\n",
    "Your groundwater modelling project (FloPy, MODFLOW) doesn't interfere with your surface water analysis (HydroMT, xarray). Each has its own environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Professional Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Consultancies, research institutions, and government agencies increasingly require reproducible workflows. Using virtual environments is standard practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine this scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "2024: You analyze discharge data for a client\n",
    "      - pandas 2.0, scipy 1.11, your custom scripts\n",
    "      - Results: Q100 = 450 m³/s\n",
    "\n",
    "2027: Client asks you to update the analysis with new data\n",
    "      - You open the project, run `uv sync`\n",
    "      - Same packages, same versions, same methodology\n",
    "      - Add new data, rerun → Updated Q100 = 470 m³/s\n",
    "      - Results are directly comparable!\n",

    "## Common Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Do I need to understand all this to use Python?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "No! You just need to know:\n",
    "1. `uv init` creates a project\n",
    "2. `uv add` installs packages\n",
    "3. `uv run` runs your scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "The conceptual understanding helps when things go wrong, but day-to-day usage is simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Why not just use Anaconda/conda?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda is another popular tool, especially in scientific computing. However:\n",
    "- It's heavier (larger installation)\n",
    "- Mixing conda and pip packages can cause issues\n",
    "- uv is faster and simpler for pure Python workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "If your workplace uses conda, that's fine! The concepts are the same. We teach uv because it's modern, fast, and beginner-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"What if I already have Python installed?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "That's okay! uv manages its own Python installations separately. Your existing Python won't interfere, and uv won't touch it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Is uv stable enough to use?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. Despite being new (2024), uv is backed by Astral, a well-funded company with experienced developers. It's already used by many companies and recommended by Python experts."
