    "## What is VS Code?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** is a free text editor designed for writing code. Think of it like Microsoft Word, but for programming instead of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why VS Code?\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Benefit for Water Modellers |\n",
    "|---------|-----------------------------|\n",
    "| **Free & Open Source** | No license costs, use anywhere |\n",
    "| **Cross-platform** | Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux |\n",
    "| **Excellent Python support** | Syntax highlighting, debugging, IntelliSense |\n",
    "| **Integrated terminal** | Run scripts without switching windows |\n",
    "| **Extensions** | Add features like Jupyter notebook support |\n",
    "| **Widely used** | Lots of tutorials and community support |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Not Just Use Notepad or a Simple Text Editor?\n",
    "\n",
    "You *could* write Python in Notepad, but VS Code offers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Syntax highlighting** — Different parts of code appear in different colors, making it easier to read\n",
    "- **Auto-completion** — Suggests code as you type, reducing typos\n",
    "- **Error detection** — Shows problems before you run the code\n",
    "- **Integrated terminal** — Run your scripts without leaving the editor\n",
    "- **File explorer** — Navigate your project files easily\n",
    "\n",
    "These features save time and reduce frustration, especially when learning."
